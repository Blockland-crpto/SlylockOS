Security
===========
SlylockOS is a Operating system designed to have efficenticy and security at its forefront, as such, Slylock takes security very seriously and people that work on it in the future and present should take steps to ensure security in every way, the following list is the security guidelines that Slylock developers are to take to ensure its security:
- in any case, all git commits must be examined for undefined behavior and/or errors that may compromise Slylocks security, reliability or otherwise
- input validation must take place as much as possible
- stack protection is to be used as much as possible
- security must also be compact to the utmost extent without compromise
- 

more are going to be added soon
